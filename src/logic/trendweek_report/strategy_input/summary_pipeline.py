"""Trend summarization and recommendation prompt builder.

This module defines data models for trend analysis and constructs a chat prompt
template used to generate summaries with strategic recommendations based on
provided context. It integrates Pydantic models for structured output and uses
LangChain's output parser and template builder.

Classes:
    Recommendation: Represents strategic recommendations for a trend.
    Trend: Represents a trend with explanation and related recommendations.
    Trends: A wrapper for a list of Trend objects.

Functions:
    build_prompt_template: Constructs and returns a chat prompt template.
