    "# Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "TL;DR\n",
    "Given data $X$, find a function $f$ which maps $X$ on to $y$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f: X -> y$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the goal is to learn a mapping from input data $X$ to an output $y$. Given a dataset of input-output pairs, the objective is to find a function $f$ that best maps each input $X$ to its corresponding output $y$. This function $f$ can then be used to predict the output for new, unseen inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Key Concepts:\n",
    "    - Training Data: A set of input-output pair ($X$, $y$) used to train the model. The input $X$ can be a single feature or a set of features, and $y$ is the corresponding target value.\n",
    "    - Function $f$: The model or algorithm that maps inputs to outputs $y$. This function is learned from the training data.\n",
    "    - Prediction: Once the function $f$ is learned, it can be used to predict the output $\\hat{y}$ for new input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Types of Supervised Learning:\n",
    "    - Regression: When the target variable $y$ is continuous. For example, predicting house prices based on features like size and location.\n",
    "    - Classification: When the target variable $y$ is categorical. For example, classifying emails as spam or not spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "    - Regression: Given a dataset of house prices with features such as size, number of bedrooms, and location, supervised learning can be used to predict the price of a house based on these features. The function $f$ would map the features (input $X$) to the price (output $y$).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Classification: Given a dataset of emails labeled as \"spam\" or \"not spam,\" supervised learning can be used to classify new emails. The function $f$ would map the email features (input $X$) to the categories \"spam\" or \"not spam\" (output $y$).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Process of Supervised Learning:\n",
    "    - Data Collection: Gather a dataset with input-output pairs.\n",
    "    - Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for training.\n",
    "    - Model Selection: Choose an appropriate algorithm to learn the mapping function $f$.\n",
    "    - Training: Use the training data to learn the function $f$.\n",
    "    - Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using a separate set of data (validation or test data).\n",
    "    - Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is widely used in various applications, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics, due to its effectiveness in learning from labeled data and making accurate predictions."
