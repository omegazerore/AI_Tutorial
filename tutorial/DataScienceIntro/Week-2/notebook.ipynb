    "## Two-Sample t-test\n",
    "\n",
    "The two-sample t-test is a statistical hypothesis test used to determine if two independent samples have different means. It assesses whether the difference in the means of two groups is statistically significant or if it could have occurred by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works:\n",
    "- Null Hypothesis (\n",
    "$H_0$\n",
    " ): There is no significant difference between the means of the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternative Hypothesis (\n",
    "$H_a$\n",
    "​\n",
    " ): There is a significant difference between the means of the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Each group follows a normal distribution.\n",
    "    - The variances of the two groups are equal (for the equal variance t-test, also known as Welch's t-test if unequal variances).\n",
    "    - The samples are independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test Statistic: The test statistic (t-statistic) is calculated based on the difference in sample means adjusted for sample sizes and standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision: If the calculated t-statistic is larger than a critical value from the t-distribution (based on chosen significance level, usually 0.05), then we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between the means of the two groups."
